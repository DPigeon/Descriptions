# Edge - Web Application (Currently a Private Repository) 
It is being made with 5 other collegues (Ribal, Anas, Ruslan, Maria and Marwan).
This web application was made with:

- React.js with JavaScript, HTML and CSS on the frontend (I worked on frontend a lot)
- NodeJS and Express with MySQL on the backend (I worked on backend a little bit)

It is a social platform. It can be compared to Facebook.

### The user can login and signup succesfully. Once he is logged in, the dashboard shows up along with his name on the side.
### The user can post on the dashboard, comment to posts and like/dislike posts.

### The user can make a new group.
