# Start: January 28th
Made by myself (DPigeon)

- React-Native with JavaScript

It is a small game with puzzles to solve. The goal is to reach the highest amount of points within a frame of time.

When opened, the application has 4 buttons. The Play Beta is for testing (for now).

Then, when you press the "Play" button, you can begin the game ! As you can see, every time you tap an icon, you make a point
(see the bubble on the bottom right). Some icons are bad for your points though...

The user can see his current score by tapping the point bubble.
