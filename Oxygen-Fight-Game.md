This game was made in my Intro to Game Development Class (COMP376).

### The goal of the game is to collect all golden items and bring them to the ship.

Two modes available: normal mode and special mode (ability to obtain a boost tank to go fast).

### Controls

You may use the left, down & up arrows to play. To swim upwards, use the Z key by tapping it.
When in Special Mode, use the space bar to activate the Nitro Gold Tank.
